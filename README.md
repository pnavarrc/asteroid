This project is a proof of concept of an algorithm to generate ESLint rules from test cases.

## Algorithm

The idea is to take examples of expressions we want to forbid in the code, compute the Abstract Syntax Tree of each one and remove the differences between the trees. This will result in a partial tree, a schema, that can be used to identify the same pattern in new expressions.

### Example

Letâ€™s imagine that we want to forbid the usage of calls to `console.log` in a codebase. We start by adding examples of the invalid code for training:

1. `console.log("a")`
2. `console.log("b", "c")`
3. `console.log(c, d)`

We can generate the AST for each one of these examples and find the intersection of them, to obtain a partial tree. This partial tree represents what the examples have in common. We will call this partial tree the _schema_.

1. `console.log("a")`

```yaml
- CallExpression
  - callee: MemberExpression
    - object: Identifier
      - name: "console"
    - property: Identifier
      - name: "log"
  - arguments:
    - 0: Literal
      - value: "a"
```

2. `console.log("b", "c")`

```yaml
- CallExpression
  - callee: MemberExpression
    - object: Identifier
      - name: "console"
    - property: Identifier
      - name: "log"
  - arguments:
    - 0: Literal
      - value: "b"
    - 1: Literal
      - value: "c"
```

3. `console.log(c, d)`

```yaml
- CallExpression
  - callee: MemberExpression
    - object: Identifier
      - name: "console"
    - property: Identifier
      - name: "log"
  - arguments:
    - 0: Identifier
      - name: "c"
    - 1: Identifier
      - value: "d"
```

Starting from the first tree, we compare the tree with the second tree, removing the properties that are not common to both. The result will be a partial tree, which we can compare with the third example and so on. The result of this operation will be the schema.

```yaml
- CallExpression
  - callee: MemberExpression
    - object: Identifier
      - name: "console"
    - property: Identifier
      - name: "log"
```

We can compare this schema with new expressions, like `console.log(a, "b", c)`. Since its AST matches the schema, ESLint should trigger a warning

## Usage

This is just a proof of concept, there is nothing to install or use directly. If you want to try it out and experiment with it, feel free to clone/fork it, install the dependencies and run the tests.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run test
```
